Supported:
* Transformation motion blur only
* Meshes: translate, rotate and scale motion blur
* Camera: translate, rotate motion blur
* `instantaneousShutter` camera attribute

Limitations:
* In USD it's possible to have an arbitrary number of time samples that fall in shutter interval. We sample only edge values.

Motion blur is controlled by two key components:
* Shutter interval of the active camera
* Time sampled transformation
