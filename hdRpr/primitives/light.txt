Supported:
* Dome light
* Distant light
* Point Light
* Spot Light
* IES Light
* Sphere light
* Disk light
* Rect light
* Cylinder light

Limitations:
* Geometry lights (sphere, disk, rect and cylinder) are approximated with cubes in Low-High qualities. That's made so because Low and Medium qualities do not support area lights (they simply not processed in lighting computations)
