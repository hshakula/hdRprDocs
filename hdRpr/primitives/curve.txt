Supported:
* primvars: `points`, `widths` (varying (per segment) and vertex interpolation), `st` (constant and uniform (per curve) interpolation)
* wrap: `segmented`, `nonperiodic`, `periodic`
* type: `linear`, `cubic`
* basis: `bezier`

Limitations:
* No native support for linear curves. They are emulated through bezier basis: each segment of linear curve (2 points) is expanded into 4 points of bezier basis
* `CatmullRom` and `bspline` bases interpret as linear
* Each segment of the bezier curve uses only widths from edge points (two middle widths is dropped as there are no way to pass them in RPR core API)
