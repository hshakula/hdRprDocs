hdRpr supports HdMesh primitives and all standard primvars:
* st primvar name is automatically resolved if bound material network has corresponding `varname` for st token
* points primvar can be computed (usdSkel)

Limitations:
* Subdivision supported in `Full` quality only
* Corner and crease indices of subdivision surface are not supported
* `displayColor` primvar has very limited effect, if no material for mesh present then we will shade mesh with the first available color in `displayColor` primvar
