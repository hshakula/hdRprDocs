### Manual install

Add a new Houdini package with such configuration json:
```
{
    "env":[
        {
            "RPR":"path-to-the-package"
        },
        {
            "HOUDINI_PATH":"$RPR/houdini"
        },
        {
            "PATH":"$RPR/bin"
        }
    ]
}
```
where `path-to-the-package` depends on where do you unzip hdRpr package and should point to the directory that contains INSTALL.md

### Automatic install

`activateHoudiniPlugin.py` script can do the same for you automatically - it will try to find your houdini preference dir and add hdRpr package that will point to the current directory.
Python3 required.
